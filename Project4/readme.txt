- Implemented 'q', 'Q', esc to exit the program
- loaded a .png image file in with the DevIL library
- textured a quad with texture coordinates 0,0 to 1,1
- textured a second quad with texture coordinates 0,0 to 2,2 with repeated texturing
- mipmapping is applied to the second quad while the first is nearest neighbor
