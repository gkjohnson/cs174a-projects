# Fractal Visualization

## Assignment Notes
#### Done
- Implemented 'q' and 'Q' to exit the program
- Implemented shaders - source within character arrays in the main.cpp file
- Implemented the Sierpinski Gasket
- Implemented in a hopefully understandable manner

#### Extra Credit
- Implemented a GLSL uniform variable that can be used to change the display color
- Implemented a method to change the color (keys 1-9 change the color)
- Implemented two extra fractal functions (tree fractal and snowflake fractal) that can switched between by pressing the spacebar
- Implemented a GLSL uniform variable that can be used to change the rotation

## Controls
```
Q, ESC        Quit

A             Increase rotation
D             Decrease rotation
S             Reset rotation to 0
Mouse Drag    Rotate to mouse position

1-9           Change color
SPACE         Change displayed fractal
```
